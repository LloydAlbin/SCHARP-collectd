# 
# ds-name:ds-type:min:max
# ds-type: ABSOLUTE, COUNTER, DERIVE, or GAUGE
# Use counter if you value only increases to show the difference between readings.
# min and max define the range of valid values for data stored for this data-source.
# If U is specified for either the min or max value, it will be set to unknown, meaning that no range checks will happen.
